      Road segment statistics for OBS events
  buffer_size: 4
  fields:
    distance_overtaker_min: |
      Overtaker minimum distance in meters.
    distance_overtaker_max: |
      Overtaker maximum distance in meters.
    distance_overtaker_mean: |
      Overtaker mean distance in meters.
    distance_overtaker_median: |
      Overtaker median distance in meters.
    distance_overtaker_array: |
      All overtaker distance values in meters.
    overtaking_event_count: |
      Number of overtaking events.
    usage_count: |
      Number of times the road was traveled on.
    direction: |
      Contains -1 for events while going along the way backwards, 1 for
      forwards. Each road is emitted twice, if it has data for both directions,
      even if it is oneway.
    zone: |
      ural or urban
    offset_direction: |
      Factor for offset to shift the line to the driving side. One of -1, 0, 1.
