    This page allows you to export parts of the public dataset under
    the license for data announced in the privacy statement of this
    site.

    Please consider this export **experimental** and expect the data
    shape to change in the future. Automated usage of this export
    functionality is discouraged for now. Try not to use too much computing
    capacity when exporting data, so select the bounding box as small as
    possible and do not exceed unreasonable poll frequencies.

    description: |
      The overtaking events from all tracks are always public in an anonymized
      form. This option is about publishing the *full* track (where you were
      cycling) for everyone to see together with your username.

      Checking this box allows all users to see your full track. For your own
      privacy and security, make sure to only publish tracks in this way that
      do not let others deduce where you live, work, or frequently stay. Your
      recording device might have useful privacy settings to not record
      geolocation data near those places.

      In the future, this site will allow you to redact privacy sensitive data
      in tracks, both manually and automatically. Until then, you will have to
      rely on the features of your recording device, or manually redact your
      files before upload.

      After checking this box, your data essentially becomes public. You
      understand that we cannot control who potentially downloads this data and
      and keeps a copy, even if you delete it from your account or anonymize it
      later.

      **Use at your own risk.**
