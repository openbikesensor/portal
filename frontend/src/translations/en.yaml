    This page allows you to export parts of the public dataset under
    the license for data announced in the privacy statement of this
    site.

    Please consider this export **experimental** and expect the data
    shape to change in the future. Automated usage of this export
    functionality is discouraged for now. Try not to use too much computing
    capacity when exporting data, so select the bounding box as small as
    possible and do not exceed unreasonable poll frequencies.
