## 0.6.2

### Improvements

## 0.6.1

### Improvements

* Make road details request (clicking on a road segment in the map) way faster
  by using PostGIS geometry index correctly (#226).

## 0.6.0

Starting in this version, the database schema is created through migrations
instead of using the `reset_database.py` script. This means that for both the
initial setup, as well as for upgrades, only the migrations have to be run.

After updating and migrating, it is good practice to regenerate the SQL tile
functions (`api/tools/prepare_sql_tiles.py`) as well. It doesn't matter if you
do this when it is not required, so we've written a simple all-in-one update
script that you can run to do all upgrade tasks. This is now in
`api/tools/upgrade.py`.

Please check [`UPGRADING.md`](./UPGRADING.md) for more details if you're
upgrading an existing installation. It contains an important note for this
upgrade in particular.
